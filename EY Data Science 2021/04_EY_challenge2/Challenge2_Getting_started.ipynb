    "Airborne infrared linescan images are currently considered one of the best sources of information about fire intensity and location. However, there are times when it is not possible to acquire infrared linescan imagery, for example due to resource contraints or unsafe conditions. An alternative source of images for fire mapping is via satellite. The availability and resolution of satellite imagery has increased substantially in recent years, making it possible to monitor bushfires from space. Satellite imagery is not always available, however it is a valuable complement to other information sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the number of satellite passes per day is continuing to increase, especially with commercial operators expanding their service offerings, there are still long periods when there is no coverage. For times when neither linescan nor satellite data are available, it is possible to extrapolate from previous observations to forecast the current location of the fire. It can also be useful for firefighting teams to forecast future locations of fire based on current observations.\n",

    "\n",

    "The training dataset you worked with in Challenge 1 contains 129 linescan images, plus an additional 5 linescan images that were used for testing. These images were captured over seven different fire events. For each of the fire events, a narrative sequence of images can be produced from a combination of linescan and satellite images. In two of the seven fire events, linescan images have been withheld at key time points. Your task is to produce a map of the fire at those time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Challenge 1, the `test.csv` file contains the details of the pixels that you must forecast using the narrative series of each fire event.\n",
    "\n",
    "All linescan and satellite images are served via the Open Data Cube python library.\n",
    "\n",
    " To forecast the fire spread over time, you may need to use information such as:\n",
    "- terrain, vegetation type and vegetation condition prior to the fire (available from satellite images), for example the NDVI product as a proxy for fuel loading or land use type (see resources in the 02_Real_world_examples folder)\n",
    "- linescan and satellite images taken during the fire\n",
